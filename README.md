# Hawaii climate analysis
In this assignment, I did climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii!. I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration.

Precipitation Analysis : By using a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.and plot the result with 'date' and                                    'prcp'.

Station Analysis :     calculated number of stations and find out most active station and Plotted the histogram for last 12 months of                              temperature observation data (tobs).

Climate App :           Designed a Flask API and created all routes that are available based on the developed queries

Temperature Analysis :  Plotted Bar chart for the min, avg, and max temperature by using  the calc_temps function to calculate the min,                             avg,and max temperatures for  trip using the matching dates from the previous year.

Daily Rainfall Average : Plotted an area plot  for the daily normals by using 'daily_normals' function which calculate the daily normals                             for a specific date

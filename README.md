In this assignment, I did climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii!. 

Precipitation Analysis : By using a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.and plot he result with 'date' and                                    'prcp'.Below is summary statistics for the precipitation data.

        prcp
count	2015.000000
mean	0.176462
std	0.460288
min	0.000000
25%	0.000000
50%	0.020000
75%	0.130000
max	6.700000

Station Analysis :     calculated number of stations and find out most active station and Plotted the histogram for last 12 months of                              temperature observation data (tobs)..

Climate App :           Designed a Flask API and created all routes that are available based on the developed queries

Temperature Analysis :  Plotted Bar chart for the min, avg, and max temperature by using  the calc_temps function to calculate the min,                             avg,and max temperatures for  trip using the matching dates from the previous year.

Daily Rainfall Average : Plotted an area plot  for the daily normals by using 'daily_normals' function which calculate the daily normals                             for a specific date
